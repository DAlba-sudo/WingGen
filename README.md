# WingGen

### What is this?
The WingGen project was a 2-week long project done in collaboration with a fellow student during the final weeks of the 2021 Summer Semester at Georgia Institute of Technology. WingGen is able to optimize the shape of a wing through the use of a genetic algorithm. Allowing engineers to decrease the set of design parameters.

### Are there limitations?
There are *many* limitations. This is due to the fact that currently the project is able to optimize according to a very limited fitness function which attempts to simulate drag through the use of a wing's surface area sum. This strategy is my attempt to perform a low-budget CFD, but unfortunately the wing's are also modelled as a matrix of squares which exist only on the x and y plane.

## Are there any plans for the future?
No and yes! WingGen will not continue to see any updates, but I've started working on another project for the A1B AeroGroup which utilizes similar strategies for the design of a rocket.
